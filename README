README
======


This project is a small example (and base for vraptor 3 - restful support) for restful services in the meaning that a restful service is only a restful service if it provides a way to work with hypercontent.

TEST IT LIVE!
=============

Access http://restful-client.appspot.com/ and try to post an order to:
a) entry point: http://restful-server.appspot.com/order
b) method: post
c) name: order
d) content: any order content (it will not be validated)

After posting the order, you will receive a 201 response with your order location. Simply access it to be allowed to view it.
You can then choose to do something with that order through the hyperlinks received (i.e. cancel it by sending a DELETE to the uri given by
the resource itself).
